## ✨ Introduction

OpenStock is a modern stock market app powered by Next.js (App Router), shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, Better Auth for authentication, MongoDB for persistence, Finnhub for market data, TradingView widgets for rich charting, and Inngest for reliable background jobs. It’s designed to be practical for professionals and welcoming for students — no paywalls, no gatekeeping.

## 🌍 Open Dev Society Manifesto <a name="manifesto"></a>

We live in a world where knowledge is hidden behind paywalls. Where tools are locked in subscriptions. Where information is twisted by bias. Where newcomers are told they’re not “good enough” to contribute.

We believe there’s a better way.

- Our Belief: Technology should belong to everyone. Knowledge should be open, free, and accessible. Communities should welcome newcomers with trust, not gatekeeping.
- Our Mission: Build free, open-source projects that make a real difference:
    - Tools that professionals and students can use without barriers.
    - Knowledge platforms where learning is free, forever.
    - Communities where every beginner is guided, not judged.
    - Resources that run on trust, not profit.
- Our Promise: We will never lock knowledge. We will never charge for access. We will never trade trust for money. We run on transparency, donations, and the strength of our community.
- Our Call: If you’ve ever felt you didn’t belong, struggled to find free resources, or wanted to build something meaningful — you belong here.

Because the future belongs to those who build it openly.

## 🤸 Quick Start

Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm or npm
- MongoDB connection string
- Finnhub API key (free tier supported; real-time may require paid)
- Gmail account for email (or update Nodemailer transport)
- Optional: Google Gemini API key (for AI-generated welcome intros)

Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-Dev-Society/OpenStock.git
cd OpenStock

# choose one:
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

Configure environment
- Create a `.env` file (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))
- Verify DB connectivity:
```bash
pnpm test:db
# or
npm run test:db
```

Run development
```bash
# Next.js dev (Turbopack)
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Run Inngest locally (workflows, cron, AI)
```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

Build & start (production)
```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start
# or
npm run build && npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create `.env` at the project root:

```env
# Core
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Finnhub
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key
# Optional client-exposed variant if needed by client code:
NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY=
FINNHUB_BASE_URL=https://finnhub.io/api/v1

# Inngest AI (Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Email (Nodemailer via Gmail; consider App Passwords if 2FA)
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=youraddress@gmail.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

Notes
- Keep private keys server-side whenever possible.
- If using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables, remember they are exposed to the browser.
- In production, prefer a dedicated SMTP provider over a personal Gmail.

## 📡 Data & Integrations

- Finnhub
    - Stock search, company profiles, and market news.
    - Set `FINNHUB_API_KEY` and `FINNHUB_BASE_URL` (default: https://finnhub.io/api/v1).
    - Free tiers may return delayed quotes; respect rate limits and terms.

- TradingView
    - Embeddable widgets used for charts, heatmap, quotes, and timelines.
    - External images from `i.ibb.co` are allowlisted in `next.config.ts`.

- Better Auth + MongoDB

    - Session validation via middleware; most routes are protected, with public exceptions for `sign-in`, `sign-up`, assets and Next internals.

- Inngest
    - Workflows:
        - `app/user.created` → AI-personalized Welcome Email
        - Cron `0 12 * * *` → Daily News Summary per user
    - Local dev: `npx inngest-cli@latest dev`.

- Email (Nodemailer)
    - Gmail transport. Update credentials or switch to your SMTP provider.
    - Templates for welcome and news summary emails.
