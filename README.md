# OpenStock Frontend

OpenStock is an open-source alternative to expensive market platforms. Track real-time prices, set personalized alerts, and explore detailed company insights ‚Äî built openly, for everyone, forever free.

**Note**: This is the frontend repository. The backend API is now powered by Spring Boot. See the [Backend Repository](https://github.com/tranlong204/OpenStock-Backend) for the API server.

**Important**: OpenStock is community-built and not a brokerage. Market data may be delayed based on provider rules and your configuration. Nothing here is financial advice.

## ‚ú® Introduction

OpenStock Frontend is a modern React application built with Next.js (App Router), shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. It communicates with a Spring Boot backend API for authentication, data persistence, and market data integration.

## üåç Open Dev Society Manifesto <a name="manifesto"></a>

We live in a world where knowledge is hidden behind paywalls. Where tools are locked in subscriptions. Where information is twisted by bias. Where newcomers are told they're not "good enough" to build.

We believe there's a better way.

- Our Belief: Technology should belong to everyone. Knowledge should be open, free, and accessible. Communities should welcome newcomers with trust, not gatekeeping.
- Our Mission: Build free, open-source projects that make a real difference:
    - Tools that professionals and students can use without barriers.
    - Knowledge platforms where learning is free, forever.
    - Communities where every beginner is guided, not judged.
    - Resources that run on trust, not profit.
- Our Promise: We will never lock knowledge. We will never charge for access. We will never trade trust for money. We run on transparency, donations, and the strength of our community.
- Our Call: If you've ever felt you didn't belong, struggled to find free resources, or wanted to build something meaningful ‚Äî you belong here.

Because the future belongs to those who build it openly.

## ü§∏ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm or npm
- Spring Boot backend running (see [Backend Repository](https://github.com/tranlong204/OpenStock-Backend))
- MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)
- Finnhub API key (free tier supported)

### Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tranlong204/OpenStock.git
cd OpenStock

# choose one:
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### Configure Environment
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```env
# Backend API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# Optional: Override default API endpoints
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT=10000
```

### Start Development
```bash
# Start the frontend development server
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

### Start Backend
Make sure the Spring Boot backend is running:
```bash
# In the backend repository
cd ../OpenStock-Backend
./start.sh
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## üîê Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` at the project root:

```env
# Backend API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# Optional: API timeout (milliseconds)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT=10000

# Optional: Enable debug logging
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=false
```

**Notes:**
- All `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are exposed to the browser
- The backend handles all sensitive operations (authentication, database access, API keys)
- For production, update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to point to your deployed backend
